# Reinforcement Learning Course
Following along the course on Deep Reinforcement Learning by Huggingface (hosted [here](https://huggingface.co/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction?fw=pt))

## Unit 1
Using proximal policy optimization (PPO) to solve the lunar lander gym environment. PPO is a policy gradient method published [by OpenAI in 2017](https://openai.com/blog/openai-baselines-ppo/) with the aim to balance implementation difficulty, efficient sampling and ease of tuning. The method is very easy to use through the stable baselines library. I ended up with a trained agent achieving a score of 267.75 (placing 178th out of 1591 entries at the time of writing).
